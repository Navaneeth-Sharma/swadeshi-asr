# Swadeshi-ASR

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is an independent, machine-based process of decoding and transcribing oral speech. A typical ASR system receives acoustic input from a speaker through a microphone, analyzes it using a model or algorithm, and produces an output, usually in text. ASRs can be built using various approaches and this code
is based on the End to End Deep Learning approach.The end-to-end model uses deep learning to build a single model to directly map audio to characters or words.
It replaces the engineering process with the learning process and needs no domain expertise, so the end-to-end model is simpler for constructing and training.

Below is the general working pipeline of the End to End model:
